## Project Overview
This is an AI and Machine Learning project focused on prompt optimization that can be embedded in other AI models to suggest the most efficient prompts.

## Code Style and Standards
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write comprehensive docstrings for all classes and functions
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Architecture Patterns
- Use modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Implement the Repository pattern for data access
- Use Factory pattern for model creation
- Apply Strategy pattern for different optimization algorithms
- Follow dependency injection principles

## Machine Learning Specific Guidelines
- Use scikit-learn for traditional ML algorithms
- Implement proper data validation and preprocessing
- Use cross-validation for model evaluation
- Implement proper feature engineering pipelines
- Use joblib for model serialization
- Include comprehensive model evaluation metrics

## Natural Language Processing Guidelines
- Use spaCy or NLTK for text preprocessing
- Implement proper tokenization and normalization
- Use transformer models from Hugging Face when appropriate
- Implement semantic similarity measures
- Use proper text vectorization techniques

## API and Integration Guidelines
- Use FastAPI for REST API endpoints
- Implement proper request/response validation with Pydantic
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement proper rate limiting and authentication
- Provide comprehensive API documentation

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all core functionality
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Use mocking for external dependencies
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage

## Prompt Engineering Specific Guidelines
- Implement prompt templates with variable substitution
- Use semantic analysis for prompt understanding
- Implement prompt complexity scoring
- Use A/B testing framework for prompt comparison
- Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement
